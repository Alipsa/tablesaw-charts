# Tablesaw Charts
This library is intended to be contributed to the tablesaw project once it is working well
It describes a higher level of abstraction compared to jsplot and enables a tech.tablesaw.chart to be 
rendered in various formats e.g as an image, plot.ly javascript, javafx component, pdf etc.
